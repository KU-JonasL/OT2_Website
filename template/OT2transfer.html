        The opentrons OT2 can use a wide variety of labware, however, not all labware has a predefined value in the OT2 system. As such the zipfolder also contain custom labware definitions (.json files) that you will to upload to the OT2 app. See more at the <a href="https://support.opentrons.com/s/article/Import-a-custom-labware-definition">Opentrons Webiste</a>. The custom labware has been verified in our lab, however it is always recommend to run a dry run to examine compatability.
